BarcodeReader
=============

Read barcodes with webcam

With this script i try to read barcodes with the webcam.

i used 2 different git repositorys:

https://github.com/EddieLa/BarcodeReader

And:

https://github.com/pieterprovoost/barcode  
(this one i could not get to work that is why i took the first and merged it with the idea behind this one)

Some barcodes are not readed simple 8 digit codes just not read.
Seems also codes starting with 7| fails aswell.

Also Chrome sometimes snapps.

It took hours to get this working in firefox , it requires the .htaccess , but also must enable header_module in apache.

Feel free to adapt this code and commt to it.It sure needs improvements.
